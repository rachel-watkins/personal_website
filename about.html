      <h1 class="about">I absolutely love my job and helping out my team. I do, however, believe in a strong work-life balance. So when I'm not working I'm doing the following things.</h1>

        <h2>Traveling</h2>

        <p>
          I was blessed with a set of parents who have always loved traveling. They have been taking me to foriegn countries ever since I was a small child. The first trip I ever went on was to Disney World with my whole family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ever since then I've had this stron love for traveling. It doesn't even have to be a far away country. Just getting out of my house on the weekends to go to a new town or try a new restaurant are some of my favorite things to do. Just this last weekend I went to a new restaurant called Bar Arbolada. The have probably the best cheeseburger in Oklahoma City! 
        </p>
        <p>
          I do, however, really love to travel to far away places. In my twenties I was fortunate enough to teach English in Taiwan. During my time abroad I was able to visit China, Japan, and Malaysia. In China I took a toboggan down the Great Wall. In Japan I went to the famous Fish Market and in Malaysia I was able to fee monkeys and elephants.

        <h2>Playing Volleyball</h2>
        <img src="volleyball.jpg">
        <p>
          My family has been playing volleyball my whole life. My Aunt Linda lived on five acres so we had plenty of room for a volleyball court. We would set it up every Fourth of July and at every Pool Party at her house. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Now just because we played often doesn't mean we were any good. None of us had played regularly, so most of our games were more entertainment than competition. That was until my niece started playing. She ended up going to college to play volleyball so she really elevated our games.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a group of friends that I now play with every Monday. It brings me back to the times at my Aunt's house where everyone is laughing and having a good time. Trust me, we do try and win but even if that is not possible we always have fun.
