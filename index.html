      <h2>I enjoy finding bugs and creating automated tests to speed up the bug finding process. I have worked as a Quality Assurance Engineer for over five years. When I'm not working I enjoy spending time with my nieces and nephews. I also try my best to travel to a new place in the world at least once a year. </h2>
